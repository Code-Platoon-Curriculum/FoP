Write a program that takes a (integer) number of cents, from 0 to 99, and outputs how many of each type of coin would represent that amount with the fewest total number of coins. When you run your program, it should match the following format:

Number of cents: 87
Your change will be:
Q: 3
D: 1
N: 0
P: 2

Hint: You may find the mod operator (%) useful.

You may not use any loops.
